# Ecommerce-backend-

This project aims to create an online shopping platform that allows customers to browse and buy products easily. Users can buy through it at any time and from anywhere in the world, which gives them great flexibility. The customer does not have to go to the store to buy his needs, and adhere to the working hours that may not suit his circumstances,
and replace that with shopping through a computer, or smartphone applications of the online store.

The e-commerce site will be a platform for a single seller to display his products for sale. The site will have an interface that allows customers to browse products and add items to the shopping cart. In addition, there will be an interface that displays the cart products and allows the customer to edit his purchases, whether to add products, delete purchases from the cart, or update them. There will also be a payment process when registering on the site. As an administrator, additional features are added to the site,
such as displaying and tracking orders and adding a product to the product catalog.

he features that this application offers:
. Registration: The application allows customers to register on the site and create an account by entering their basic information such as name, password, phone number and address.
. Product catalog: A comprehensive product catalog will be created that allows customers to browse and search for products according to different categories such as price, brand, size, color and others.
. Shopping cart: A shopping cart will be provided where customers can add the products they want to buy. The shopping cart will display the total amount of the purchase and allow customers to modify the quantity of items in the cart. The following figure shows the interface for the customerâ€™s purchases and the total amount.
. Add product: This feature is for the administrator. When clicking on the add button, a questionnaire about the information of the added product is displayed. When submitting, the new product is displayed in the catalog.
. View orders: This feature is also for the administrator, where it allows him to view incoming orders and track them.
